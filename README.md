## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The most challenging part of this project was creating the "Mastered Button." I spent a lot of time on it, and I even went to office hours for help. Additionally, determining the Similarity Threshold was not easy. I had to do a lot of research, and I mostly relied on resources from the internet.
